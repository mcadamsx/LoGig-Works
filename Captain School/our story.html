                        <h6><strong>The sitution</strong>
                            <p>Significant disparities exist in the support systems and opportunities available to the
                                youth,
                                children are more vulnerable in times of economic challenges and Ghana is no exception.
                                Captain schools provide free tuition, high-quality education to children who — due to
                                poverty
                                and social pressures — would otherwise be unlikely to complete their schooling. Drawn
                                from
                                families who often live on less than $1.25 per day, the pupils of Captain Schools are
                                shining
                                examples of what students can achieve when they are given the opportunity to receive a
                                quality
                                education. <br>
                                The Global Goals
                                Education equips learners with the skills and values needed to be responsible global
                                citizens,
                                such as respect for human right, gender equality and environmental sustainability.
                                Investing in
                                and strengthening a country’s education sector is key to the development of any country
                                and its
                                people. Without investment in quality education, progress on all other developmental
                                indicators
                                will stagnate. <br>
                                Education is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty.
                                We must therefore ensure that all children irrespective of where they live get a quality
                                education,
                                prioritizing the most vulnerable. <br>

                                low income households and people living in abject poverty. <br>
                                The passion of most parents is to educate their wards however possible for them to be
                                the agents

                                We cannot disregard the oil exploration that has begun in this region and its immediate
                                and

                                This project is the first of its kind in the region and proves to be scalable and will
