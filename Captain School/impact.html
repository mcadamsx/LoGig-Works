                        volunteer nurses and doctors, checking eyesight, monitoring height and weight, deworming and 
                        looking for any potential health issues. We are correctly working on sponsorship to help renew 
                        the National Health Insurance status of our students. In addition, students receive education on 
                        simple matters such as nutrition, malaria and dental hygiene.
                        Captain Schools also has a Welfare Team with three volunteering medical officers. The Welfare 
                        team work within the school community to identify and help with any problems at home or at the 
                        school. In the past the Welfare Team has helped with problems including abuse, peer pressure, 
                        alcoholic family members, or neglect. The school and parents and teachers work closely together 
                        to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all.

                     <h3>Research shows that, the provision of improved education opportunities for the girl child may 
                        help them delay marriage and childbirth, increase girls independence and greater self-esteem. 
                        Captain Schools is facilitating changes in traditional community mindsets. In Africa, girls are 
                        often considered second class citizens and many families believe that it is a waste of time 
                        educating them, putting a lot of pressure on girls to drop out of school or fall victim to early 
                        marriage.
                        Captain Schools firmly believes in the education of girls. The school does not discriminate when 
                        selecting students although over the years we have educated more female than male students. 
                        Our female teachers and leaders are strong role models to students.
                        By preparing a generation of children and youth with a solid foundation in literacy, numeracy, 
                        and problem-solving skills, we aim to not only transform the lives of the children and their 
                        families, but to catalyze increased development in the region and the nation at large.
